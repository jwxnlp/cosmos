# Cosmos3 Generator Action Examples

Cosmos3-Nano action-generation examples across two inference backends — native
PyTorch (Cosmos Framework) and vLLM-Omni. Both backends use the sample assets
under [`assets/`](./assets) and cover two tasks:

- **Forward dynamics (`fd`)** — predict future observations from a start image
  plus an action trajectory (AV, DROID, and UMI robotics examples).
- **Inverse dynamics (`id`)** — predict ego-motion trajectories from input AV
  videos.
- **Policy** — act as a closed-loop control policy: given the current
  observation, a task goal, and optionally the robot's proprioceptive state,
  predict the next actions to execute on a robot, streaming them continuously to
  drive a simulated or real robot.

Environment setup for both backends is centralized in the shared
[Cosmos3 cookbooks environment setup](../../README.md) guide; each backend below
links to the section you need.

## Action Definition

Cosmos3 treats action as a modality whose tokens represent transitions between
consecutive visual states. This cookbook follows the unified action interface
defined in the paper: ego and end-effector poses are represented as 9D pose
deltas, consisting of 3D translation and a 6D continuous rotation representation.
Grasp state encodes the current manipulation state, using a 1D open-close value
for grippers or a 15D human-hand representation with 3D state for each of 5
fingers.

| Embodiment | Representation | Dimensionality | Unit | Post-processing | Generation duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Autonomous vehicle | Ego pose (9D) | 9D | Meter | Normalization | 60 frames @ 10FPS |
| [DROID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12945) | End-effector pose (9D) + gripper grasp state (1D) | 10D | Meter | Multiview concatenation, `to-OpenCV`, normalization | 16 frames @ 15FPS |
| UMI | End-effector pose (9D) + gripper grasp state (1D) | 10D | Meter | Normalization | 16 frames @ 20FPS |

## Run with Cosmos Framework

### Quickstart

Set up the environment: [Cosmos Framework setup](../../README.md#cosmos-framework).
Activate the framework venv, then run the native inference entrypoint. Forward
dynamics on Nano looks like:

```bash
torchrun --nproc-per-node=1 \
  -m cosmos_framework.scripts.inference \
  --parallelism-preset=throughput \
  -i <forward-dynamics input spec>.json \
  -o /tmp/cosmos3_action_fd \
  --checkpoint-path Cosmos3-Nano \
  --seed=0
```

The input spec pairs a start image with an action trajectory. The notebooks
assemble ready-to-run specs for AV, DROID, and UMI examples from the checked-in
assets under [`assets/`](./assets). Outputs are written under the framework
checkout.

### Cosmos Framework Notebook Walkthrough

The Cosmos Framework notebooks build their input spec, run inference, and
visualize the generated videos:

- [`run_fd_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb`](./run_fd_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb) —
  forward dynamics for AV, DROID, and UMI robotics examples.
- [`run_id_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb`](./run_id_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb) —
  inverse dynamics, predicting ego-motion trajectories from input AV videos.

### Policy server
To serve Cosmos3-Nano-Policy-DROID as a policy server that streams actions to a
client driving a simulated or real robot, see
[`run_policy_with_cosmos_framework.md`](./run_policy_with_cosmos_framework.md).

## Run with vLLM-Omni

### Quickstart

Set up the environment: [vLLM-Omni setup](../../README.md#vllm-omni).
Start the server from this folder. The container listens on port 8000; the
example publishes it to host port 8001:

```bash
docker rm -f cosmos3-vllm-omni-notebook 2>/dev/null || true

docker run -d --name cosmos3-vllm-omni-notebook \
  --runtime nvidia --gpus '"device=0"' \
  -e CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  -p 8001:8000 --ipc=host \
  vllm/vllm-omni:cosmos3 \
  vllm serve nvidia/Cosmos3-Nano \
    --omni \
    --model-class-name Cosmos3OmniDiffusersPipeline \
    --allowed-local-media-path / \
    --port 8000

# Wait until this returns model metadata before sending requests:
curl http://localhost:8001/v1/models
```

Forward-dynamics requests are multipart `POST`s to `/v1/videos` — a start image
under `files={"input_reference": ...}` plus an `extra_params` payload carrying the
action trajectory. The vLLM notebook builds the full request body for AV,
DROID, and UMI examples, including autoregressive chunked generation for the
robotics examples.

### Notebook walkthrough

The vLLM-Omni notebooks send requests through the OpenAI-compatible video API and
write outputs under `outputs/cosmos3_action_vllm/`:

- [`run_fd_with_vllm.ipynb`](./run_fd_with_vllm.ipynb) — forward dynamics for AV,
  DROID, and UMI robotics examples.
- [`run_id_with_vllm.ipynb`](./run_id_with_vllm.ipynb) — inverse dynamics,
  predicting ego-motion trajectories from input AV videos.



## TODO

- [ ] Add additional embodiment examples.
